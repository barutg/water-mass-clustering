# water-mass-clustering
This R script provides a full analysis pipeline for oceanographic data. It uses the tidyverse to clean, interpolate, and standardize profiles. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed for dimensionality reduction, followed by K-means clustering to identify distinct water mass assemblages.
